# Day 1 - Machine Learning Notes  

## Topics Covered
- What is Machine Learning?
- Types of ML (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement)
- Difference between AI, ML, and DL  

## Key Points
- ML is about making machines learn from data.  
- Supervised → Data with labels.  
- Unsupervised → Data without labels.  
- Reinforcement → Learning by rewards and punishments.  

## Example Code
```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
