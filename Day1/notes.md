# Day 1 - Machine Learning Notes

## Basics of Machine Learning
- **Machine Learning (ML):** A field of AI that allows systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

## Difference Between AI, ML, and DL
| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **AI** | Artificial Intelligence – broad concept of machines performing tasks intelligently |
| **ML** | Machine Learning – subset of AI where machines learn from data |
| **DL** | Deep Learning – subset of ML using neural networks with many layers |

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
- Uses **labeled data** (input + output) to train the model.
- **Goal:** Predict output based on input data.

**Types:**
1. **Regression**  
   - Output variable is **numerical**.  
   - Example: Predict house prices, temperature, sales.
2. **Classification**  
   - Output variable is **categorical**.  
   - Example: Spam email detection, disease prediction (Yes/No).

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- Only **input data** is provided; the model finds patterns in the data.  
- **Goal:** Discover hidden structure or groupings in data.

**Types:**
1. **Clustering**  
   - Divides data into groups (clusters) based on similarity.  
   - Example: Customer segmentation, grouping similar articles.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**  
   - Reduces number of features while retaining important information.  
   - Example: PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for visualization or preprocessing.
