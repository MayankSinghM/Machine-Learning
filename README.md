# Machine-Learning
  Day 1 of Maachine learning
  >> learn about the basic definition of ml
>  > difference between Ai vs ml vs dl
>  > learn about types of machine learning
>  > based on supervision-:
>  > 1.supervised learning:used labeled data need to provide both input and output data to model and model train with it
>  > i. Regression: Basically in these type of data where dependent variable in numerical form.
>  > ii. Classification: Where the output variable or independent variable value is in categorical form
>  >
>  > 2.unsupervised Learning: we only provide input data to model and model find pattern in the input data and according to it it predict some patterins in data and predict output data for us.
>  > Tyoes:
>  > i.Clustering: it find a mathematical expression in data and divide them in different clusters and when a new data comes it uses these previous data points to predict the values where can it lies.
>  > ii.Dimensionality Reduction:
